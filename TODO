* TODO Complete the dlvhex API (output, intput, ...)
Plugins should behave as passively as possible, i.e., no registration
of data like namespaces or similar information *initiated* from the
plugins.

* TODO Semantics API
Design proper interfaces for different semantics, e.g., HEX, WFS,
etc. Should we allow plugins to add new semantic computations?

* TODO Let plugins maintain global state in the program itself

Like

#document(foobar.xml)
a(X) :- &xpath['//person'](X).


* TODO Use boost spirit instead of flex/bison

* TODO Use parse tree representation in Optimizer

* TODO Query support

* TODO Magic Set rewriting

* TODO Add support for RIF BLD presentation syntax

* TODO [Mac OS X] Install user plugins in ~/Library/Application Support/dlvhex/plugins

* TODO [Mac OS X] Add pkg/dmg package support?

* TODO [Linux] Add deb/rpm package support?

* TODO [Windows] Add dll loading support
We may build dlvhex with cygwin; unfortunately, the plugin loading
part is nonfunctional. configure --enable-shared is not working, and
we need to tweak the symbol exporting pragmas.

* TODO How to deal with plugin dependencies?
What's more, how to deal with plugins that are unable to "cooperate,"
e.g., the sparql-plugin is not able to process combined sparql
statements and rules.

* TODO Fix Term's namespace handling

* TODO Is our rewriting architecture with streams adequate? Can we do better?

* TODO We need to parse things like "10"^^xsd:integer or "foo is not \"bar\""
Symboltable should do back-and-forth translation of dlvhex symbols to generix dlv symbols.

* TODO dlvhex server mode
inetd (Linux) and launchd (Mac OS X) should be enough:

Add the next line to /etc/services in order to enable the dlvhex
service (we chose port 51966 because it is 0xCAFE in HEX):

dlvhex 51966/tcp

Add this line to /etc/inetd.conf:

dlvhex stream tcp6 nowait  root /usr/local/bin/dlvhex dlvhex --silent --inetd --

(you can use update-inetd on debian/ubuntu)
