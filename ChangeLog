	* include/dlvhex/PluginInterface.h: (setOptions): Modified argument type.

	* src/dlvhex/AtomSet.cpp: (operator<) Corrected semantics of AtomSet
	comparison.

	* src/dlvhex/GuessCheckModelGenerator.cpp: (compute): Corrected bug in
	creation of guessing rules - replacement atoms for external atoms were
	created without input arguments.

	* src/dlvhex/dlvhex.cpp: (main): Updated option handling, passing
	unparsed options to plugins and aborting, if any options are left
	after plugins. Commented out dlt-preparsing. Activated
	plugin-rewriters.

	* src/testsuite/dlvhex/TestGraphProcessor.cpp: (testSimple): Removed
	debug output.

	* src/testsuite/dlvhex/TypeTest.cpp: (testConstruction): Added test
	for set of AtomSet comparison.

	* include/dlvhex/AtomSet.h: Added operator< for comparison of sets of AtomSets (does
	not work yet).

	* src/testsuite/dlvhex/ASPsolverTest.cpp: (tearDown): Added reset of
	AtomFactory after each test in order to avoid conflicting atoms.

	* src/testsuite/dlvhex/TestGraphProcessor.cpp: Added.

	* src/testsuite/dlvhex/Makefile.am: Added dlvhex-sources necessary for
	the new TestGraphProcessor class.
