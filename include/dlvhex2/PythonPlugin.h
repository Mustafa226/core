/**
 * \defgroup pythonpluginframework The Python Plugin Framework
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * dlvhex evaluates Answer Set Programs with external atoms. One important
 * design principle was to provide a mechanism to easily add further external
 * atoms without having to recompile the main application.
 * With dlvhex version 2.4.0 a \em Python plugin interface was introduced,
 * which supports Python scripts that provide functions to realise custom external atoms.
 *
 * This Section gives an overview of dlvhex Python plugins and external atoms.
 *
 * \section extatom The External Atom Function
 *
 * Formally, an external atom is defined to evaluate to \e true or \e
 * false, depending on a number of parameters:
 * - An interpretation (a set of facts)
 * - A list of input constants
 * - A list of output constants
 * .
 * However, it is more intuitive and convenient to think of an external atom not
 * as being boolean, but rather functional: Depending on a given interpretation
 * and a list of input constants, it returns output tuples. For instance, the
 * external atom to import triples from RDF files has this form:
 *
 * \code
 *   &rdf[uri](X,Y,Z)
 * \endcode
 *
 * where \c uri stands for a string denoting the RDF-source and \c X, \c Y, and
 * \c Z are variables that represent an RDF-triple. The function associated with
 * this atom simply returns all RDF-triples from the specified source.
 * Obviously, in this case the interpretation is ignored.
 *
 * \subsection informationflow Information Flow
 *
 * The interface that is used by dlvhex to access a plugin follows very closely
 * these semantics. For each atom, a retrieval function has to be implemented,
 * which receives a query-object and has to return an an answer-object. The
 * query-object carries the input interpretation as well as the ground input
 * parameters of the external atom call, while the answer object is a container
 * for the output tuples of the external atom's function.
 *
 * \subsection inputtypes Types of Input Parameters
 *
 * Theoretically, it is completely up to the atom function how to process the
 * interpretation together with the input constants, which are basically only
 * names. In practice however, only parts of the interpretation might be needed
 * (if at all). Considering this as well as for efficiency reasons, we created
 * two (in the implementation three, see below) categories of input parameters:
 * - the Constant parameter and
 * - the Predicate parameter.
 * A third category called Tuple exists, which is a meta category standing for
 * an arbitrary mount of Constant input parameters. This is useful, e.g.,
 * for &concat[s1,s2,...](Out).
 * 
 * A parameter of type "Constant" is not related to the interpretation at all,
 * like in the previous example of the RDF-atom. A parameter is of type
 * "Predicate" means that all facts in the interpretation with this predicate
 * are necessary for the atom. Let's assume, we have an external atom that
 * calculates the overall price of a number of books given by their ISBN number:
 *
 * \code
 *   &overallbookprice[isbn](X)
 * \endcode
 *
 * The single input parameter of this atom would be of type "Predicate", meaning
 * that not the constant itself is necessary for the atom's function, but the part
 * of the interpretation with this predicate.  So if we have, e.g.,
 * \f[
 * I=\{{\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}19{-}824183{-}6}), {\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}201{-}99954{-}4}), p(a), q(b),\ldots\}
 * \f]
 * the atom's function will be called with a "reduced" interpretation:
 * \f[
 * I=\{{\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}19{-}824183{-}6}), {\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}201{-}99954{-}4})\}
 * \f]
 * Specifying the type of input parameters not only helps to single out the
 * relevant part of the interpretation, but also supports dlvhex in calculating
 * the dependencies within a HEX-program.
 *
 * \section writingpythonplugin Writing a Python Plugin
 * We wanted to keep the interface between dlvhex and the plugins as lean as
 * possible.
 * Necessary tasks are:
 * - Write a new Python script which contains a \em register function and imports the package \em dlvhex
 * - Write another function for each external atom, and export this function using the \em register function
 *
 * The \em register function has the following form:
 * \code
 * def register():
 *   dlvhex.addAtom ("concat", (dlvhex.CONSTANT, dlvhex.CONSTANT), 1) )
 * \endcode
 * It adds one \em entry for each external atom. Each \em entry is
 * again a tuple of arity 3: the first element is the external predicate name,
 * the third element is the output arity, and the second is another tuple of input parameter types (dlvhex.CONSTANT, dlvhex.PREDICATE, dlvhex.TUPLE).
 *
 * Each external predicate name (e.g. \em concat) needs to be implemented in form of another Python function with an appropriate number of input parameters.
 * \code
 * def concat(a, b):
 *   dlvhex.outputValues(dlvhex.getValue(a), dlvhex.getValue(b))
 * \endcode
 * Here, \em a and \em b are the input parameters (of type constant).
 * The function just takes the values of these parameters and outputs their string concatenation.
 * Note that akin to the \ref pluginframework "C++ API", terms and atoms are represented by IDs and the retrieval of the value behind
 *
 * usually requires the use of the \em getValue method; some methods combine this with other functionalities (see method list below).
 *
 * In more detail, the \em dlvhex Python module provides the following methods:
 *   <em>tuple getTuple(aID)</em>: Return the IDs of the elements of a dlvhex atom identified by ID \em aID.
 *   <em>tuple getTupleValues(aID)</em>: Return the values of the elements of a dlvhex atom identified by ID \em aID.
 *   <em>string getValue(id)</em>: Return the value of an atom or term ID \em id.
 *   <em>dlvhex.ID storeString(str)</em>: Stores a string \em str as dlvhex object and returns its ID.
 *   <em>dlvhex.ID storeInteger(int)</em>: Stores an integer \em int as dlvhex object and returns its ID.
 *   <em>dlvhex.ID storeAtom(args)</em>: Transforms a sequence of terms or values \em args into a dlvhex atom.
 *   <em>dlvhex.ID negate(aID)</em>: Negates an atom ID \em aID.
 *   <em>bool learn(tup)</em>: Learns a nogood as a tuple of atom IDs or their negations \em tup; returns if learning was enabled.
 *   <em>ID storeOutputAtom(args)</em>: Constructs an output atom from IDs or values \em args (for learning purposes) and returns its ID.
 *   <em>void output(args)</em>: Adds a tuple of IDs or values \em args to the external source output.
 *   <em>tuple getInputAtoms()</em>: Returns a tuple of all input atoms to this external atom.
 *   <em>int getInputAtomCount()</em>: Returns the number of input atoms.
 *   <em>bool isAssigned(id)</em>: Checks if an input atom identified by ID \em id is assigned.
 *   <em>bool isTrue(id)</em>: Checks if an input atom identified by ID \em id is assigned to true.
 *   <em>void addAtom(name, args, ar, [prop])</em>: Add external atom "name" with arguments \em args (see above), output arity \em ar and external source properties \em prop ("prop" is optional).
 *
 * External source properties \em prop are of type <em>dlvhex.ExtSourceProperties</em> and can be configured using the following methods:
 *   <em>void prop.addMonotonicInputPredicate(index)</em>: Declare argument \em index as monotonic predicate parameter.
 *   <em>void prop.addAntimonotonicInputPredicate(index)</em>: Declare argument \em index as antimonotonic predicate parameter.
 *   <em>void prop.addPredicateParameterNameIndependence(index)</em>: Declare argument \em index as independent of the predicate name (only its extension is relevant).
 *   <em>void prop.addFiniteOutputDomain(index)</em>: Declare that output argument \em index has a finite domain.
 *   <em>void prop.addRelativeFiniteOutputDomain(index1, index2)</em>: Declare that output argument \em index2 has a finite domain wrt. input argument \em index1.
 *   <em>void prop.setFunctional(value)</em>: Declare the source as functional.
 *   <em>void prop.setFunctionalStart(index)</em>: Declare the source as functional beginning at term index + 1.
 *   <em>void prop.setSupportSets(value)</em>: Declare that the source provides support sets.
 *   <em>void prop.setCompletePositiveSupportSets(value)</em>: Declare that the source provides complete positive support sets.
 *   <em>void prop.setCompleteNegativeSupportSets(value)</em>: Declare that the source provides complete negative support sets.
 *   <em>void prop.setVariableOutputArity(value)</em>: Declare that the source has a variable output arity.
 *   <em>void prop.setCaresAboutAssigned(value)</em>: Declare that the sources wants to know the assigned values.
 *   <em>void prop.setCaresAboutChanged(value)</em>: Declare that the sources wants to know the values which potentially changed since the previous call.
 *   <em>void prop.setAtomlevellinear(value)</em>: Declare the source as linear on the atom level.
 *   <em>void prop.setUsesEnvironment(value)</em>: Declare the source as linear on the tuple level.
 *   <em>void prop.setFiniteFiber(value)</em>: Declare that the source has a finite fiber.
 *   <em>void prop.addWellorderingStrlen(index1, index2)</em>: Declare that output argument \em index1 has a string length wellordering wrt. input argument \em index2.
 *   <em>void prop.addWellorderingNatural(index1, index2)</em>: Declare that output argument \em index1 has a natural wellordering wrt. input argument \em index2.
 * 
 * Moreover, for an ID object \em id, there are the following shortcuts:
 *   <em>id.value()</em> for <em>dlvhex.getValue(id)</em>
 *   <em>id.intvalue()</em> for <em>dlvhex.getIntValue(id)</em>
 *   <em>id.tuple()</em> for <em>dlvhex.getTuple(id)</em>
 *   <em>id.tuplevalues()</em> for <em>dlvhex.getTupleValues(id)</em>
 *   <em>id.negate()</em> for <em>dlvhex.negate(id)</em>
 * 
 * In order to load a Python-implemented plugin stored in file PATH,
 * pass the additional option \code --pythonplugin=PATH \endcode to dlvhex.
