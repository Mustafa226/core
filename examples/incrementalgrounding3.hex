% Expected result: { p(a) }, { p(b), in(b), res(b) }

% The example tests if duplication of models after program expansion is avoided.
% For the guess p(a), the domain does not need to be expanded since in(a) cannot be derived.
% However, later when p(b) is guessed (assuming that p(a) is guessed before p(b), which is the case with the default heuristics of clasp 3.1.0),
% the domain needs to be expanded and the model enumeration algorithm is restarted.
% However, it is important the the previously found model { p(a) } is not repeated.

in(a) :- p(b).
