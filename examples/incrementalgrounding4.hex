% This program checks if the minimality check works for incrementally grounded programs.
% Expected result: {p(a),f,t,s,x}
%                  {p(a),ff,x}
%                  {p(b),f,t,s,x}
%                  {p(b),ff,x}

% (1) This part can be immediately grounded:
p(a) v p(b).
f v ff.		% makes sure that the next two rules are not optimized away
t :- f.
s :- t.

% (2) This part can be grounded after some model including { p(a) } was enumerated:
x :- &id[p](X).	% is optimized away before enumeration of a model.
t :- s, x.	% likewise

% Since the cyclic dependency between s and t involves the external atom and
% is only visible after &id[p](a) was added in the second iteration,
% a non-incrementaln minimality check also produces the models {p(a),ff,x,s,t}, {p(b),ff,x,s,t}
