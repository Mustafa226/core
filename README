* Dependencies
dlvhex depends on following libraries and programs:

** boost
http://www.boost.org/

** cppunit (optional)
http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/


* Building and installing dlvhex

** Prerequisites

*** boost
Follow the instructions of the INSTALL file found in the distributions tarball.
Popular Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora, Debian, and NetBSD include
pre-built Boost packages. 

*** cppunit (optional)
Follow the instructions of the INSTALL file found in the distributions
tarball. dlvhex has been tested with cppunit 1.10.2.


** Configuration
Run "configure" to create the necessary Makefiles. As usual, use the --prefix
switch to specify a custom installation location. If you installed boost in a
non-standard folder, use CXXFLAGS=-I/path/to/includes to specify the location
of the header files.

** Testing
Run "make check" to build and execute the cppunit-based regression
testsuite.

** Installation
Run "make install" to install the binary dlvhex and its header files, which are
needed for developing plugins.

* Running dlvhex

Using dlvhex is very similar to working with the answer-set solver dlv. "dlvhex
--help" displays a short help with available command-line parameters. For an
introduction how to write hex-programs, see
