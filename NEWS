dlvhex NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* Version 2.0.0 (??? 2012)

** Rewrite of evaluation and decomposition framework, see the paper
   "Pushing Efficient Evaluation of HEX Programs by Modular Decomposition"
   by Thomas Eiter, Michael Fink, Giovambattista Ianni, Thomas
   Krennwallner, and Peter Sch√ºller (LPNMR 2011).
** Rewrite of entity management (IDs plus Registry instead of strings).
** Extend Plugin API: ComfortPluginAtom parallel to PluginAtom.
** Add incremental model building (one model at a time).
** Add Plugin Versioniong ABI.
** Add interface for input parser modules.
** Add ASP querying support (brave, cautious, ground, nonground).
** Add multithreaded support.
** Add support for input-call stratified modular nonmonotonic logic programs (MLPs).
** Various fixes, improvements, and new testcases.


* Version 1.7.2 (October 2010)

** Fix configuration error with boost 1.44.


* Version 1.7.1 (July 2010)

** Fix dlvdb support in libaspsolver.

** Introduce better benchmarking support.

** Code clean-ups and beautifications.

** Improve speed of answer set parser.

** Fix tickets #7, #11, #12, #13, #14. 


* Version 1.7.0 (June 2010)

** This is the last dlvhex release with major number 1 and minor number 7.

** Add support for dlvdb as ASP solver (--solver=dlvdb).

** Introduce dlvhex namespace.

** Introduce OutputBuilder interface, which allows plugins to have their own output formats.

** Sanitize Plugin interface.

** Use libltdl for loading the plugins.

** Add support for retrieving HEX-programs via HTTP (or whatever protocol libcurl supports).

** Use a more efficient replacement name technique for external atoms.

** Add support for a simple caching strategy for external atoms (turn off with --nocache).

** Support for nonmonotonic external atoms (instantiate your external atom with PluginAtom(false)).

** Install libdlvhexbase.so and libaspsolver.so in $libdir instead of $pkglibdir (e.g., instead of /usr/local/lib/dlvhex, they are now located in /usr/local/lib).

** Use singleton interface for the name tables, caused a nasty bug with duplicate global Term::names instantiations.

** Fix ticket #1.


* Version 1.6.0 (August 2007)

** Variable arities of external atom input lists.

** Debugged model-generation algorithm.

** Added switch --reverse for reverse ordering of weak constrained models.

** Added GPL license.

** Improved documentation.
